          We celebrate African craftsmanship through contemporary design — each piece tells a story
          of heritage and innovation. Our fabrics are sourced ethically and tailored with precision
          to bring timeless elegance to modern fashion. At Batik & Thread, we bridge the gap between
          traditional African artistry and contemporary style, creating pieces that honor the past
          while embracing the future.
